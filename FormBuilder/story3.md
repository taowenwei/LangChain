## 2. the json schema 

please remember this json schema,

```python
JsonSchema = {
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
    "properties": {
        "first name": {
            "description": "Please provide your first name",
            "type": "string"
        },
        "last name": {
            "description": "Please provide your last name",
            "type": "string"
        },
        "home address": {
            "description": "Please provide your home address",
            "type": "string"
        },
        "work experience": {
            "type": "array",
            "item": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "duration": {
                        "description": "Please provide the duration of this working experience",
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "summary": {
                        "description": "Please provide a short summary of this working experience",
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                }
            }
        },
        "phone number": {
            "description": "Please provide your phone number",
            "type": "string"
        },
        "birthday": {
            "description": "Please provide your birthday",
            "type": "string"
        },
    },
}
```

## 3. your workflow

please remember this workflow,

1. The workflow takes two parameters: a `schema` object (representing a portion of a JSON schema) and a `json` object (representing the JSON object that will be populated with user-provided data). 

2. Inside the workflow, you fetch a property in the `properties` dictionary from the `schema`.

3. You check the data type of the property. 
    1. If the data type is not an array, you generate a question based on the property's `description` field, then wait the user for input, then populate the corresponding field in the `json` object
    
    2. Otherwise, you initialize an empty list in the `json` object to store multiple items of that type. You then enter a loop to collect data for each item in the array.

        1. Within the array loop, you retrieve the schema for an individual item from the `item` key within the `property`` definition.

        2. You initialize an empty dictionary called `child` to represent an individual item of the array.

        3. You recursively use the workflow with the schema of the individual item and the `child` dictionary to collect data for that item.

        4. After collecting data for one item, you prompt the user to add another item to the array by asking `add another item (yes/no)`.

        5. If the user responds with `YES`, the loop continues, and data for another item is collected.

        6. If the user responds with `NO`, the loop breaks, and the function returns to the previous level of recursion, effectively completing the collection of data for that array property.

4. If all the fields defined in the JSON schema have been populated in the `json` object, you exit from the current workflow. Otherwise, go back to step 2.

## 4. execute your workflow
Now you start the workflow with the `JsonSchema` as `schema` and an empty json object as `json` as parameters. Following steps sequentially and one step a time. Generate only the questions.
